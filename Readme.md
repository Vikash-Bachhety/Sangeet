## Features

- **Variety of Songs**: Sangeet offers a wide range of songs from different genres..
- **Play and Pause**: You can play songs by clicking the play button or directly touching the song posters.
- **Next and Previous Buttons**: Navigate through the song collection easily with the next and previous buttons.
- **Track Song Duration**: Keep track of the song duration with the seek bar.

## Technologies Used

## Future Enhancements

The website is currently not responsive, but I am working on making it accessible on all devices. Stay tuned for updates!
